# Reliable data transfer protocol
The nodes are able to be run independently of each other. Each node is able to send to another however the paths are set and not dynamic.(eg. node 1 always routes through node 2 to get to node 4). The nodes are able to deal with nodes leaving and coming back online when sending messages to each other. 

The current design sends strings however a conversion to datagrams/files would be reliably simple. To test sending messages all nodes intended to be tested should be run independently of each other. Then simply follow the on-screen prompts to send a message. The initial send attempt to a node that must be "hopped" to will always fail as the default ttl is set to 1 for demonstration purposes. Following that failed attempt the node will automatically resend with an increased ttl and succeed if the destination node is available. A checkmark is displayed by the message if it is acknowledged by the destination node and an x is displayed if it fails to acknowledge.
